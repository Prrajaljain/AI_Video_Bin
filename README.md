AI Crowd Monitoring System 👥
📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on real-time Crowd Detection and Monitoring using Artificial Intelligence. By processing video feeds, the system can estimate crowd density and monitor movement patterns, which is essential for safety and urban planning.

🛠️ Tech Stack
AI/ML: TensorFlow, OpenCV

Vision Logic: Object detection models (like YOLO or CNNs) for person counting

Version Control: Git/GitHub for collaborative development and portfolio building

🚀 Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Setup & Data Prep: Establishing the environment and gathering crowd datasets

Phase 2: Model Implementation: Training a detection model to identify individuals in varying light and density

Phase 3: Logic & Analysis: Developing algorithms for density heatmaps and flow tracking

Phase 4: Deployment: Integrating the system for real-time monitoring

📂 Repository Structure
/src: Core Python scripts for video processing and inference.

/models: Trained model weights and configuration files.

/notebooks: Initial research and data analysis.
